# A word machine is a system that performs a sequence of simple operations on a stack of integers. 
# The sequence of operations is given as a string and operations are separated by single spaces. 
# The following operations may be specified:
# - Any integers between 0 and 2 ** 20 âˆ’ 1 is pushed into the stack
# - "POP removes the top most number from the stack
# - "DUP" pushes a duplicate of the top most number into the stack
# - "+" pops the two top most elements from the stack, adds them together, 
#   and pushes the sum into the stack
# - "-" pops the two top most elements from the stack, subtracts the second one from the first, 
#   and pushes the difference onto the stack
# After processing all the operations, the machine returns the topmost value from the stack.
